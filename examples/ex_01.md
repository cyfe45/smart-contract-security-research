# Exercise 1: "100 Ways To Break It" (45 minutes)

Use a simple DeFi primitive (staking pool, simple swap, vault) and set timer for 45 minutes

Generate ~100 different hypothesis about how it could break:

"What if I call this function from a contract?"
"What if I pass zero as input?"
"What if I'm both the sender and receiver?"
"What if I call this twice in same transaction?"
"What if the price oracle returns 0?"

Don't verify yet - just generate. This builds the "what if"
