## Applying Complex System Analysis to Smart Contract Security Research

Below is an approach to applying **Complex System Analysis** principles to **Smart Contract Security Research**:

Based on a Youtube video by [Alisa Esage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS1Ecpxs7IU&t=40s)

1. **Overcoming Intimidation in DeFi Codebases**

    â€¢ As a new smart contract security researchers one might feel overwhelmed by the complexity of **DeFi protocols**.
    
    â€¢ Approach each protocol **without intimidation**, but with structured curiosity.
    
    â€¢ Recognise that smart contract structures follow **common patterns**, e.g., proxy patterns, access controls, upgradeable contracts.

3. **Forming a Big-Picture Hypothesis**

    â€¢ Before diving into the code, hypothesise about the **architecture** of the smart contract system.
    
    â€¢ Identify the **main components** (e.g., governance, liquidity pools, reward mechanisms).
    
    â€¢ Map out **dependencies**, external calls, and storage layouts.

3. **Identifying Core Components & Attack Surfaces**

    â€¢ Focus on key contract elements (e.g., **owner-controlled functions, external dependencies, token transfers**).
    
    â€¢ Apply **fractal analysis** by starting from high-level contract relationships and then drilling down to individual functions and state changes.
    
    â€¢ Use **pattern recognition** to detect vulnerabilities like **reentrancy, unchecked calls, or permission mismanagement**.

4. **Leveraging Documentation**

    â€¢ **Protocol whitepapers**
    
    â€¢ **OpenZeppelin standards/blog** (where applicable)
    
    â€¢ **Audit reports**
    
    â€¢ **On-chain transaction history** (Etherscan if available)
    
    â€¢ Cross-check theoretical security assumptions with **real-world contract deployments**.

5. **Recursive Reiteration for Deeper Insights**

    â€¢ Initially scan for high-level risks, then refine the analysis to more nuanced issues (e.g., gas optimisations, MEV risks).
    
    â€¢ Shift between **static analysis** (reading code, Slither) and **dynamic analysis** (testnets, fuzzing).

6. **Practical Application: Reverse Engineering Solidity Contracts**

  â€¢ Use a structured approach:
    1. **Hypothesis**: What does the contract do? What are its core functions?
    2. **Big Picture**: How does it interact with external systems?
    3. **Component Identification**: Owner roles, storage patterns, upgrade mechanisms.
    4. **Verification & Refinement**: Test transactions, compare with known vulnerabilities.
    5. **Recursive Deep Dive**: Look for **edge cases, protocol assumptions, and unhandled exceptions**.

7. **Use the code base to expand your EVM, Solidity and Security Risks Knowledge**

  â€¢ To learn faster and more focused use the codebase to explore and learn more focused. One learns much faster when applying it to a specific problem and looking for solutions.  
  	â€¢	**Active Learning via Code Exploration:** Rather than passively reading Solidity documentation or security guides, engaging with live codebases forces you to confront real security decisions and vulnerabilities.
  	â€¢	**Problem-Solving Enhances Retention:** Learning by tackling specific problems (e.g., analysing access control issues in a vault contract) makes the information stick much better than abstract study.
  	â€¢	**Pattern Recognition Across Protocols:** By auditing multiple DeFi protocols, you will over time internalise common security pitfalls (e.g., frontrunning risks, unchecked external calls).
  	â€¢	**EVM-Level Insights:** Debugging transactions, examining opcode traces, and understanding how Solidity compiles into bytecode will strengthen your low-level understanding of the EVM, giving you a sharper edge in auditing.

By integrating this structured approach into your **smart contract security research**, you can systematically break down complex Solidity codebases and uncover vulnerabilities more efficiently. ðŸš€
